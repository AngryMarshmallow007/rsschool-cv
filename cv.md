### About

I have been working as a front-end developer in the freelancers market and I have been very interested in gaining professional knowledge and experience from a real company.

I am purposeful and ambitious, craving for knowledges, breaking borders and reaching new goals on my educational way. Russian is my native language, but I am also fluent in English. Combined with my excellent communication skills, self-organization, leaders skills and Bachelor Diploma, these gives me a mix of talents that will make me asset to the team.
